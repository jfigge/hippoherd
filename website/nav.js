/* Hippo Herd — dismissing the nav dropdown.
 *
 * The "The Hippos" menu is a native <details>, which is what keeps it working
 * with JS off and inside the page's script-src 'self' CSP. What <details> does
 * NOT do is close: it has no light-dismiss and no Escape handling, so once
 * opened the card stays over the page until the summary is clicked again —
 * click somewhere else, scroll, tab away, and it follows you down.
 *
 * That is the whole job here. This file adds no behaviour the markup does not
 * already have; it only lets go of what the markup cannot. With this script
 * blocked the menu still opens and still closes on its own summary, which is
 * why the dismissal lives here rather than the menu itself.
 *
 * Lifted, deliberately unchanged in behaviour, from chiphippo.com/nav.js — the
 * same menu on seven sites should not close three different ways. */
